/**
 * =============================  Notification Proxy App ===================================
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION:
 *  Designed to be used with Notification Proxy Device driver; allows you to use one "proxy"/virtual device (with that
 *  driver) to route notifications to one or more "real" (or other proxy) notification devices
 
 *  TO INSTALL:
 *  Add code for parent app (this) and then and child app. Install/create new instance of parent
 *  app only (do not use child app directly).
